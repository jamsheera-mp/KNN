# 1. Environment Setup:
Tools Required:

    Google Colab: An online Python notebook platform provided by Google.
    Libraries: sklearn, numpy, matplotlib.

# 2. Data Loading and Exploration:
Data Source:

The Iris dataset is a built-in dataset available in the sklearn.datasets module.
Features:

    Sepal length
    Sepal width
    Petal length
    Petal width

Target:

Iris species: Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica.

# 3. kNN Algorithm Implementation:

The kNN algorithm works by comparing a new data point with every point in our training dataset and votes based on the k closest points.

Steps:

    Compute the Euclidean distance between the input sample and all samples in the training data.
    Sort distances and determine the closest k neighbors.
    Get the most common class label from these k neighbors.
    Return the class label as the prediction.

# 4. Data Visualization:

Using matplotlib, two types of visualizations are done:

    Distribution Visualization: This scatter plot provides insights into the distribution of the Iris dataset based on its features.
    kNN Results Visualization: After running the kNN algorithm, the true labels are plotted against the predicted labels to visually understand the model's performance.

# 5. Execution Steps:

    Open Google Colab: Create a new notebook.
    Install and Import Libraries: Use the first cell to import necessary libraries.
    Load the Iris Dataset: Load the dataset into your environment.
    Visualize Data Distribution: Create a scatter plot to see the distribution of data.
    Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
    Define kNN Class: Implement the kNN algorithm as a Python class.
    Train kNN Model: Instantiate the kNN class and train it using the training data.
    Visualize kNN Results: Create a scatter plot to visualize the true vs. predicted labels of the test set.

# 6. Conclusion:

Through this exercise, one can learn the basic implementation of the kNN algorithm and its application to a simple dataset like Iris. This serves as a foundational exercise for understanding more complex machine learning algorithms and techniques.
